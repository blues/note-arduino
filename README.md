# [Blues Wireless][blues]

The note-arduino Arduino library for communicating with Blues Wireless Notecard via serial or IÂ²C. Includes example sketches in the [examples directory](examples).

This library allows you to control a Notecard by writing an Arduino sketch in C or C++.
Your sketch may programmatically configure Notecard and send Notes to [Notehub.io][notehub].

This library is a wrapper around the [note-c library][note-c], which it includes as a git submodule.

This library is used by the [m5stack repo][m5stack] m5note Arduino sketch, which requires it to be installed per the instructions below.

## Installation

1. Download the library as a .zip file from [here][archive] or use the UI `Clone or download -> Download ZIP`
2. Start the Arduino IDE
3. Open a new or existing sketch which will talk to Notecard
4. Add the library to the Arduino IDE:
   ```
   Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library...
   ```
   and select the previously downloaded .zip file
5. Include the library in your sketch:
   ```
   Sketch -> Include Library -> Contributed libraries -> Blues Wireless Notecard
   ```
   This will have the effect of inserting this line of code at the top of your sketch:
   ```
   #include <Notecard.h>
   ```

## Keeping up to date with note-c repo

This library depends on the blues [note-c repo][note-c] and utilizes
git subtrees to include those files in the src/note-c folder. To
update this repo with the latest from note-c:

```sh
# This will create a merge commit, but that's how subtree likes to work.
git subtree pull --prefix=src/note-c --squash https://github.com/blues/note-c.git master
# If that fails, you can delete the src/note-c dir and start over with a new subtree:
git subtree add --prefix=src/note-c --squash https://github.com/blues/note-c.git master
```

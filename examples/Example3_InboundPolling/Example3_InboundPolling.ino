// This example shows the simplest possible method demonstrating how a device might poll a
// notefile used as an "inbound queue", using it to receive messages sent to the device from
// the service.  The message gets into the service by use of the Notehub's HTTP/HTTPS inbound
// request capability.
//
// In order to use this example,
// 1. Get the device up and running the code below, successfully connecting to the servie
// 2. Use the "Devices" view on notehub.io to determine the DeviceUID of the device, which
//    is a unique string that looks like "imei:000000000000000"
// 3. Use the "Settings / Project" view on notehub.io to determine the App UID of your project,
//    a unique string that looks like "app:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
// 4. At the command line of your PC, send an HTTP message to the service such as:
//    curl -L 'http://api.notefile.net/req?project="app:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"&device="imei:000000000000000"' -d '{"req":"note.add","file":"my-inbound.qi","body":{"my-request-type":"my-request"}}'
//

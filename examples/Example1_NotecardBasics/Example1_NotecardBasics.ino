// This example does the same function as the "basic" example, but demonstrates how easy it is
// to use the Notecard libraries to construct JSON commands and also to extract responses.
//
// Using the Notecard library, you can also easily set up your Arduino environment to "watch"
// JSON request and response traffic going to/from the Notecard on your Arduino debug port.
//
// Note that by using the Notecard library, it is also quite easy to connect the Notecard to
// a Microcontroller's I2C ports (SDA and SCL) rather than using Serial, in case there is no
// unused serial port available to use for the Notecard.
//

// Include the Arduino library for the Notecard

#include <Notecard.h>

// If the Notecard is connected to a serial port, define it here.  For example, if you are using
// the Adafruit Feather NRF52840 Express, the RX/TX pins (and thus the Notecard) are on Serial1.
// If however you are using an M5Stack Basic Core IoT Development Kit, you would connect the
// R2 pin to the Notecard's TX pin, and the M5Stack's T2 pin to the Notecard's RX pin, and then
// would use Serial2.
//
// Also, you may define a debug output port where you can watch transaction as they are sent
// to and from the Notecard.  When using the Arduino IDE this is typically "Serial", but you
// can use any available port.
//
// Note that both of these definitions are optional; just prefix either line with // to remove it.
//  Remove serialNotecard if you wired your Notecard using I2C SDA/SCL pins instead of serial RX/TX
//  Remove serialDebug if you don't want the Notecard library to output debug information

// This is the unique Product Identifier for your device.  This Product ID tells the Notecard what
// type of device has embedded the Notecard, and by extension which vendor or customer is in charge
// of "managing" it.  In order to set this value, you must first register with notehub.io and
// "claim" a unique product ID for your device.  It could be something as simple as as your email
// address in reverse, such as "com.gmail.smith.lisa.test-device" or "com.outlook.gates.bill.demo"

	// "NoteNewRequest()" uses the bundled "J" json package to allocate a "req", which is a JSON object
